The "GeneratedArt" was made using text input from the lines of the poem "Source" (Refer to SourceIntroDiagram.png) using "vqgan_clip.py".

Further the art style was applied to "MonochromeIllustrations" to create "ColouredIllustrations" using "style_transfer_pytorch.py".

Finally the illustrations were combined to form artpieces, which can be found under "FinalArtPieces".
